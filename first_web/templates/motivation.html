      <h1 class="diplay-6" style="font-weight: bolder;font-style: italic; color: black;">The Hero of Rezang La</h1>
      <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;color: black;">Whenever their is a discussion about the 1962 Indo-China war how can one forget about the <strong>Battle of Rezang La</strong>. And whenever we talk of the battle of Rezang La, the first thing that crops into our minds is the name of Major Shaitan Singh, who signifies heroism. <br>Major Shaitan Singh was born in Jodhpur, Rajasthan to a military family and his father was Lieutenant Colonel Hem, Singh, he served in the France with the Indian Army during the World War 1 and was awarded the Order of the British Empire. <br><strong>Ladakh, 1962:</strong><br> In the Chinese initial attack they overrun the border posts from the Daulat Beg Oldie to Damchok, along the karakoram range. The defence of the Chusul (of great significance in terms of the border dispute of Aksai Chin with China) was the responsiblity of 114 Brigade which was having one batallion less. When danger to Chusul increased the 13 Kumaon battalion rushed to assist the 114 Brigade. <br>The Charlie Company of the 13 Kumaon was given the Rezang La. It was bitterly cold with bone chilling winds, lack of protective winter clothing make the sceneario more vigil and treacherous. The main company was defended by the 7th/8th/9th platoons, in the early hours of the 18th november, Chinese army attacked the 7th and 8th platoon but our retaliation was so ferocious that hundereds of chinese lay dead and the first wave of the chinese army was repulsed. <br>After sometime some more chinese troops attacked the company and the 9th platoon came under the attack, the platoon hold their fire and waited for the enemies to come closer and when they were just 90m away the platoon opened fired over them and hundereds of Chinese dead bodies littered the 'nullahs', so the second wave of the chinese army was also repulsed. <br>Major Shaitan Singh moved from platoon to platoon motivating his men and firing over the enemy not caring about his own saftey. For the chinese the horrific rate of casualities was not bearable so they changed their tactis and brought the 9th platoon under the severe MMG fire and taking cover of that, 400 Chinese attacked the 8th platoon from the rear and 120 Chinese attacked 7th platoon from the rear. Their were heavy casulaities on both the sides. The entire 7th and 8th platoon of Charlie Company was martyred. The troops of the 9th platoon fought with them hand to hand combat since they were out of the ammunition. <strong>Naik Ram Singh</strong> killed many soldiers with the bare hands before he was shot in the head. Major Shaitan Singh was shot and when his two men were helping him the chinese army started attacking them so he ordered his men to leave him with his weapon and help the company. <br>Charlie Company repulsed total 7 attacks by the Chinese before the entire company was martyred in the combat. When the Indian Army visited the Charlie Company location after the war, Major Shaitan Singh was found holding his weapon. He had died fighting. The nursing assistant was found dead with bandages and a syringe in his hand. The mortar section commander was found dead, holding a mortar round. He kept firing till his position was overrun and he was killed. Out of the thousand mortar rounds that Charlie Company had, all but 7 had been fired. Out of the 123 soldiers of Charlie Company, 114 were martyred and 6 were captured by the Chinese Army and kept as PoWs. They later miraculously escaped. <br>122 Ahirs from Haryana, led by Major Shaitan Singh Bhati of Jodhpur, fought for “Naam, Namak, Nishan” at -30 degrees centigrade. In freezing, inhuman cold, clothed in thin sweaters and jackets, wet canvas shoes, badly equipped and armed with Second World War vintage .303 rifles, they fought against an enemy who was far better equipped and armed. <br>These brave 122 fought against 3000 attacking Chinese and counted over 1300 enemy dead before embracing martyrdom. For his action of gallantry he was awarded the <em>Param Vir Chakra</em> .</p><br>
      <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder; color: brown;">Today, a memorial stands at Rezang La, honoring the memory of those heroes. It reads: <br>

        “How can a man die better <br>
        
        Than facing fearful odds <br>
        
        For the ashes of his fathers <br>
        
        And the temples of his Gods.”</p>

      <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;color: black;">Subedar Joginder Singh was born on 26th September 1921 in Mahakalan village in Moga district of Punjab, Son of  Sri Sher Singh Saini and Bibi Krishnan Kaur. He joined the British Army on 28 Sep 1936 and was recruited into 1 Sikh of the famed Sikh Regiment. As a young soldier, he participated in World War II on Burma front and then also took part in Indo-Pak war of 1947-48 in Srinagar. <br>There had long been disagreement between India and China over disputed borders in the Himalayas region. To counter the increasing Chinese intrusions into the disputed territory, then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru asked for strategies for dealing with them. However, the proposal put forward by the Indian Army was rejected. Instead, he approved a plan proposed by a bureaucrat called the "Forward Policy". This called for the establishment of several small posts facing the Chinese positions. Due to the severe rise in public criticism against Chinese intrusions, Nehru implemented the "Forward Policy" against the advice of the army. The army's concern was that the Chinese had a geographical advantage. Additionally, maintaining numerous small posts would be untenable if the superior Chinese forces attacked. This was ruled out by Nehru who believed the Chinese would not attack. However, the Chinese did attack and this initiated the Sino-India War. <br><strong>Battle at Bum La</strong><br> On 9 September 1962, then Defence Minister of India Krishna Menon decided to evict the Chinese troops south of Thala Ridge. This decision was endorsed by Nehru, who was in London to attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. Subsequently, the 7th Infantry Brigade, was ordered to move to Namka Chu, which was considered militarily unsound and an advantageous ground for the Chinese.  <br>As the war with China became imminent, 1 Sikh regiment was also called from Jaipur. Sub Joginder Singh's platoon was positioned on a ridge in the Tongpeng La area on the Bum La axis in Tawang. On 20 Oct 1962, the Chinese attacked the Indian post at Namka Chu that was under 7th Infantry Brigade. Since they were equipped with superior arms and ammunition and having readied for the war for close to three years, they easily overran the Indian troops and made way to Tawang where Sub Joginder Singh and his men had established their post. The Chinese soldiers began to collect at the other bank of the stream and to dig trenches. It was on 23 October 1962 at 5:30 a.m. when preparations were on in the army kitchen for tea, the Chinese attacked the Tawang post. Sub Joginder Singh's platoon of 1 Sikh stood ready for the counter-attack. The Chinese attacked the post in three waves, each comprising 200 men. Though the initial two attacks were repelled successfully, by that time, the platoon was depleted to half of its original strength. Singh was also wounded but refused evacuation. Soon the ammunition was exhausted, and the survivors were only left with their bayonets.<br>The Sikh soldiers then charged toward the Chinese, shouting the war cry Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh. Finally, better weapons and numerical superiority of the Chinese prevailed and Sub Joginder Singh was captured as a POW after this epic battle.<br>Before Singh was overpowered and captured by the Chinese, <strong>he single-handedly killed 56 Chinese soldiers with his bayonet</strong> . He later succumbed to his injuries and died in Chinese captivity. Sub Joginder Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra for devotion to duty and inspiring leadership and bravery of highest order. As a mark of respect to the brave soldier, Chinese returned his ashes once they came to know about the Param Vir Chakra being awarded to him. Sub Joginder Singh has been immortalized in the nation's history for his outstanding act of valour and will remain one of the greatest soldiers, Indian Army has ever seen.</p>
